# Encrypt-Decrypt Program

## Overview
This is a simple **file encryption and decryption** program written in **C++**. It uses a **Caesar cipher** algorithm to shift characters in the text. The user can choose to **encrypt** or **decrypt** a file by providing the filename and selecting a mode.

## Features
- Encrypts a text file using **Caesar cipher** (shift of `+3`).
- Decrypts an encrypted file using a **reverse shift** (`-3`).
- Reads and writes files securely.
- Simple command-line interface.

## Requirements
- A **C++ compiler** (GCC, Clang, MSVC, etc.).
- A **text file** for encryption/decryption.
